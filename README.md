# Your Credit App

Your Credit is a company that has the support of a financial institution in the country, which is focused on providing loans to a defined sector of the population, consisting of natural persons linked to the military, police, navy and other authorized forces.

Currently, all customer registration information and credit application status reports generated by the bank were in physical form, in different folders in the office, but this creates problems for efficient searches of the information requested by the bank and customers.

The need arises to develop a web system to automate the needs of the company, optimizing the banking, credit and customer processes. In this sense, the company "Tu Cr√©dito" wants the implementation of this web system to be carried out using Django technology and to have the following functionalities:

1. Create administrator views to perform the following operations.
2. Create, View, Update and delete Clients (at a client URL).
3. Create and list credits (In a Credits URL).
4. Create and list banks (In a Banks URL).

## Technical Stack

## Running the system locally

To run the system locally, you must have installed Docker and Docker Compose.

Then, you must clone the repository:

```bash
git clone
```

First of all you must create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv your_env
```

Then, you must activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source your_env/bin/activate
```

In the project root, install the dependencies of the project:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
``` 

For building the database, you must run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

For database migrations, you must run the following commands:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Then, you must run the following command to build the web container:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Finally, you can access the system at:

[http://localhost:8000/client/list](http://localhost:8000/client/list)

## Running the deployed system

The whole system is deployed in Heroku, so you can access it at:

[https://your-credit.herokuapp.com/client/list/](https://your-credit.herokuapp.com/client/list/)
